# Setup and execute commands

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment; use `npm run build:prod` for a production build.
